hi buddy , if you encounter these problems : 
 - port already is use 
 - connection aborted 
for the second one make sure your file ( /var/run/docker.sock) run the right permissions (rwx)
for the first one make sure to kill the process that is using the port :
  - sudo lsof -i tcp:<port_number>
  - sudo kill -9 <PID>
